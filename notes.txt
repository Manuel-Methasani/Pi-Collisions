may want to add a way to interact with points, but better keep this
demonstration part on the power point
may want to toggle graph on and off so we can focus on collisions
because there are way too many lines with higher digits that
the circle just gets filled
better color selection
use arc from p5 library to create a function in graph.js so that, if a button
is pressed or just for some digits value we draw alternatively colored arcs on
the circumference, we need also the angle which we know through mass ratio(we could even just use the ratio and ignore atan())
try doing the css grid not only with divs but also with other ones, the div canvas 0 has a script in it which adds another div
the first one in some cases may be useless
